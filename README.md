📝 My Approach

This MERN Task App was built with simplicity and maintainability in mind:

CRUD Operations: Implemented standard Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for tasks.

State Management: Used Redux Toolkit to manage task updates and global state efficiently.

Filtering: Task filtering handled via Redux to keep state consistent across the app.

UI & Styling: Designed with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for responsive, clean, and animated task cards.

UX Enhancements: Added a floating Add button, animated Panda mascot, and smooth hover effects to make task management enjoyable.
